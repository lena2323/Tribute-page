            <ul>
                <li> September 2004: Hybrid XX computer <!-- Work-in-progress name of my computer this tribute page is about--> is born</li>

                    <p> Once upon a time, my parents owned two computer setups which they used to program in Visual Basic <!-- ????????--> (seen in the picture above). My own Hybrid XX computer<!-- ????????--> was born by a natural circumstance of those two computer setups malfunctioning, and yes, they were eventually trying to give in to the sweet release of death, but were not being able to because of the good samaritan (or a Dr Frankenstein wannabe), i.e. me,  trying to salvage the still working parts that would fit into my perfect, first ever, personal computer.</p>

                <li> November 2004:Moving</li>
                    <p> Hybrid XX computer <!-- ????????--> moves out of my parents' room into my own bedroom. It gets to keep the Samsung CRT 753s monitor because it was the one which had the buttons that still work.</p>

                <li> February 2005: It becomes a Cartoon goldmine!</li>

                    <p> Hybrid XX computer <!-- ????????--> gets its TV tuner card <!-- ????????-->. It is now able to broadcast all of the TV channels our cable TV could, the most important one being of course, Cartoon network.</p>

                <li> November 2005: Hybrid XX computer <!-- ????????-->'s case  is opened for the first time, (and left open like that)</li>

                    <p> After a full year of working perfectly, Hybrid XX computer <!-- ????????--> starts to overheat, (at least that's what I thought started happening to it) and crash an hour into watching cartoons. I was devastated. When I opened its case that gloomy sunday evening I found exactly what I really never hoped to find in its cooler. So. Much. Dust! It got cleaned with (a lot of) cotton pickers used for my ears (clean ones of course!), and that actually fixed the crashing-mid-Tom-and-Jerry problem! Woohoo! </p>

                <li> September 2006: The hard drive drinks its first glass of coke</li>

                    <p> After the cooler being full of dust fiasco, I somehow decided to keep the case opened so as it can remind me to clean the cooler once in a while. I didn't. Instead I spilled a full glass of coke on my table and myself, and with the case being under the table, the case drank it too! The hard drive took the biggest hit. I cleanded it to the best of my abilities. With a kitchen rag. While  Hybrid XX computer <!-- ????????--> was still turned on mind you. It's a miracle it still worked! After the clean up, it went back to being the best computer ever. Crisis averted? Check!</p>

                <li> December 2006: First encounter with the InTeRnEt </li>

                    <p> It was on a cold winter's morning when  Hybrid XX computer <!-- ????????????--> got its first and only ethernet cable and was finally able to connect to the internet! Beemp3 here I come! Also, for some reason it was so dull to actually visit the websites that google previewed images for, so I actually downloaded tons, and I mean tons of thumbnail images of the things i liked. So many Naruto photos... and Avril Lavigne! </p>

                <li> June 2007: The hard drive drinks its last glass of coke</li>

                    <p> Hybrid XX computer <!-- ????????-->'s 128gb hard drive which served me so well over the years, finally took its last breath in the summer of 2007. After yet another mishap with the glass of coke everpresent on my desk, decided to relocate its contents onto my lap... and the hard drive in my computer. Again.</p>
                    <p>It died carrying the weight of pirated movies such as "Braveheart", "Stewart little", and "dkkjsksdkd" <!-- ????????-->. Beautiful music, a mix of the songs from the artists the Rolling Stones, Avril Lavigne, the Beatles, Cascada, Aerosmith, The White Stripes, the Kids (Johnny Depp's band) and so many more.... all pirated. All of the downloaded thumbnails? Gone! Needless to say but that hard drive had to get replaced with a new one. Shortly after, a few days I think, Hybrid XX computer <!-- ????????--> welcomed the new hard drive that came with 256gb of space on it! The Hybrid XX computer <!-- ????????--> welcomes it with the open case (that got closed after the second glass of coke) and lives to see another day!</p>

                <li> August 2007 Upgrades all around!</li>

                    <p> The upgrades came and went. Hybrid XX computer <!-- ????????-->'s ram got upgraded first from 256mb. to 512mb, to the shocking 1gb, all in a month! After the unfortunate cleanup time, it had its little plastic legs broken, so Hybrid XX computer <!-- ????????--> also got a new cooler. The same one, just new, with unbroken plastic little legs. Cd Rom was exchanged for the new, better, DVD rom! Playing The sims 2 just became reality, oh yeah! The floppy disk drive got taken out, it was useless to me anyway, I never even owned a floppy disk!</p>

                <li> December 2008: Untimely death</li>
                <p> After so many years, so many adventures it took me on, after being my trusted friend,  Hybrid XX computer <!-- ????????--> started to beg for euthanasia. It was suffering so much, trying to keep itself alive while running the Sims 2, and dreaming of the Sims 3, it just couldn't feed my appetite for creating people in rooms with no doors anymore. On that distrurbing evening, it fell asleep one last time, and got its Windows XP put to sleep for all eternity. </p>
